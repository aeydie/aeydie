Hello!  

My name is Eydie - a fun fact is that I'm named after Eydie Gourmet.  My pronouns are she/her.  

I'm so thrilled to actively be searching for a role as a software programmer/engineer.  

I wanted to tell you a little bit more about who I am, and showcase some of my work.  

First I would like to showcase my first big project that I am creating with a group of other launchcode graduates.

This project is called AroundTown and is an application that will allow users to interact in a few different ways.  A user can either be someone that utilizes the features we will build to create events in their community, or a user can be someone that takes a look at the applicatino to find events according to their specific choices from our filter options.  The events will allow user to create or view an events name, description, cost, location, and will even drill down into more specifics such as age restriction and themes.  We will showcase our events using a mapping API that will allow users to view events by map.  
We will have seperate authorizations that users can set up for themselves, and also have a system administrator to keep track of events being created and that they meet specific requirements in order to actually be posted to our site.

Java and javascript will be used for the coding of this application.  

We are using Angular for the front end and Spring for the back end of our application.  

Dependencies that we are looking at and/or currently using are Java Web/Dev Tools, Spring Security, Spring Boot Starter for our framework, Data Jpa Validation, and more.  We will use MySql as our database.  

Our repositories can be found at:

miketully426/AroundTown-Client
miketully426/AroundTown-Server

I am always so happy to share my developments and projects, and hope that the passion, determination, and just plain excitement is shining through!

Best of the best to you, and thanks for taking a look - Eydie
